The Problem

We have been asked to construct a program that takes in a text file and generates a compressed version of the file. We decide to use Huffman's algorithm to achieve the compression. The algorithm uses a binary trie to encode each character in the input file. Frequently occurring characters are encoded with fewer bits than less frequently occuring characters.

Our program should also take in a file compressed using Huffman's algorithm and generate the decompressed version. This will be handy for testing our compression strategy.
